# Overview

This directory houses the R-scripts and other files associated with the cleaning and processing of the data from the longitudinal intermittent fasting study with collaborative cross mice. The files are organized by data-type. If you plan to re-run the data cleaning/processing scripts, it is important that the scripts for the animal data are run first followed by the scripts for the weekly bodyweight data. After that, it does not matter what order the other data types are run in. This is because the processed animal data and processed BW data are used in the cleaning/processing of all the other data-types, and the processed animal data is used in the cleaning/processing of the weekly bodyweight data.
