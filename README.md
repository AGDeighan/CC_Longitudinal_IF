# Collaborative-cross longitudinal study of intermittent fasting

This study consists of 800 mice (400 females and 400 males), evenly distributed across 10 collaborative cross strains (CC003/UncJ, CC004/TauUncJ, CC005/TauUncJ, CC006/TauUncJ, CC018/UncJ, CC019/TauUncJ, CC032/GeniUncJ, CC040/TauUncJ, CC041/TauUncJ, and CC061/GeniUncJ) and two diets (ad libitum [AL, control mice] and 2-day intermittent fasting [IF]). Thus, there are 20 replicates for each strain, sex, and diet combination. The fasting intervention was initiated when mice were 6 months old, up until 6 months all mice were on the AL diet. The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effect of intermittent fasting on aging and lifespan in mice. To this end, the mice were observed until natural death (or ethically mandated euthanization) to aquire full lifespan data and multiple assays (detailed below) were performed and repeatedly throughout their lives to assess their physiological status.

## Physiological data

Most assays were performed at 12-month intervals on all living mice. The exceptions to this are grip, frailty, and bodyweight. Grip and frailty assays were performed every six months, and bodyweights were measured every week.
